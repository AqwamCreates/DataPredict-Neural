# Beta Version 1.0.0

## Changes

* Everything related to "FirstDerivative" is renamed to "ChainRuleFirstDerivative".

* Everything related to "SecondStepFirstDerivative" is renamed to "FirstDerivative".

* Calculations for first derivative tensors inside the FunctionBlocks are now more efficient.

## Fixes

* Replaced forgotten TensorL's getSize() functions to getDimensionSizeArray().

* Fixed a bug where MaxUnpooling FunctionBlocks requires incorrect input tensors dimension sizes.
