# Beta Version 1.0.0

## Added

* Added quick linking for more faster prototyping. To use it, you need to call "<", ">" or "-" operators between two FunctionBlocks.

## Changes

* Everything related to "FirstDerivative" is renamed to "ChainRuleFirstDerivative".

* Everything related to "SecondStepFirstDerivative" is renamed to "FirstDerivative".

* Calculations for first derivative tensors inside the FunctionBlocks are now more efficient.

## Fixes

* Replaced forgotten TensorL's getSize() functions to getDimensionSizeArray().

* Fixed a bug where MaxUnpooling blocks requires incorrect input tensors dimension sizes.
