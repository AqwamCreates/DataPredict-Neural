# Beta Version 1.12.0

## Added

* Added these value schedulers under the "ValueSchedulers" section:

	* Chained
	
	* Constant
	
	* CosineAnnealing
	
	* Exponential
	
	* InverseSquareRoot
	
	* InverseTime
	
	* Linear
	
	* MultipleStep
	
	* Multiplicative
	
	* Polynomial
	
	* Sequential

	* Step

* Added these optimizers under the "Optimizers" section:

	* ResilientBackwardPropagation

 	* AdaptiveFactor

	* AdaptiveMomentEstimationWeightDecay

 	* RectifiedAdaptiveMomentEstimation

## Changes

* ValueSchedulers can now be used in place of Optimizers for scheduling learning rate.

* BaseEligibilityTrace's new() constructor function now accepts "mode" as one of its parameters under the "EligibilityTraces" section.

* The calculate() function now accepts weightTensor as the third parameter for all the optimizers under the "Optimizers" section.

* Renamed AdaptiveGradientDelta to AdaptiveDelta under the "Optimizers" section. 

* The Optimizers' "internalParameterArray" value are now set to nil instead of an empty table when calling the new() constructor and reset() function under the "Optimizers" section.

* Made some internal code changes to DeepDoubleQLearningV2, DeepDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2 and DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 models under the "Optimizers" section.

* Made the default value for "averagingRate" parameter for DeepDoubleQLearningV2, DeepDoubleStateActionRewardStateActionV2 and DeepDoubleExpectedStateActionRewardStateActionV2 models to 0.01 instead of 0.995 under the "Optimizers" section.

## Removed

* Removed TimeDecay and StepDecay from the "ValueSchedulers" section.

* Removed LearningRateStepDecay and LearningRateTimeDecay from the "Optimizers" section.

## Fixes

* Fixed some bugs in AdaptiveMomentEstimation and NesterovAcceleratedAdaptiveMomentEstimation under the "Optimizers" section.

* Fixed some bugs where BaseRegularizer and BaseEligibilityTrace returns an "Unknown" class name under the "Regularizers" and "EligibilityTraces" sections.
