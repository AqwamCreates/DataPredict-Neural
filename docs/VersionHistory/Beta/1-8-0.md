# Beta 1.8.0

## Added

* BaseWeightBlock now has the gradientAscent() function.

## Changes

* BaseWeightBlock now has the ability to perform in-place weight tensor updates and this behaviour is set to default. By setting this to default, the models are now able to train without creating additional tables and this improves the performance.
