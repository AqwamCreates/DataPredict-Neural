# Beta Version 1.5.0

## Added

* Added SoftActorCritic, DeepDeterministicPolicyGradient and TwinDelayedDeepDeterministicPolicyGradient under "Models".

## Changes

* DeepQLearning, DeepStateActionRewardStateAction, DeepExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction, ProximalPolicyOptimization models and its variants now have "lambda" argument for TD-Lambda and GAE-Lambda functionality. This includes AdvantageActorCritic model.

* The diagonalGaussianUpdate() function now requires actionNoiseTensor.

* All reinforcement learning models now require "terminalStateValue" for categoricalUpdate(), diagonalGaussianUpdate() and episodeUpdate() functions.

* Reimplemented ActorCritic, VanillaPolicyGradient and REINFORCE models.
