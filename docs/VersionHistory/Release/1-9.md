# Release Version 1.9

## Models

* Added SoftActorCritic, DeepDeterministicPolicyGradient and TwinDelayedDeepDeterministicPolicyGradient.

* DeepQLearning, DeepStateActionRewardStateAction, DeepExpectedStateActionRewardStateAction, ProximalPolicyOptimization models and its variants now have "lambda" argument for TD-Lambda and GAE-Lambda functionality. This includes AdvantageActorCritic model.

* The diagonalGaussianUpdate() function now requires actionNoiseVector.

* All reinforcement learning models now require "terminalStateValue" for categoricalUpdate(), diagonalGaussianUpdate() and episodeUpdate() functions.

* Reimplemented ActorCritic, VanillaPolicyGradient and REINFORCE models.
