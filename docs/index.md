# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict™ Neural Library!

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms And Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md).

This library was developed solo over more than 1 year (2000+ hours), which would exceed $100,000 USD in industry costs. Additionally, it requires near PhD-level knowledge to build and test all the models in this library. The cost to produce this library is significantly cheaper due to recycling of DataPredict™ (6000+ hours) library codes. To all indie devs who just starting their business, feel free to use it without burning away your money!

* Because machine, deep and reinforcement learning models try to find the best solution for you during training, you are likely (but not guaranteed) to increase your revenue over this cost.

* You're not licensing convenience; you're licensing a higher probability of increased revenue.

* Think of it this way: you’re not losing 0.5%-5% of your revenue; you’re investing 0.5%-5% to unlock the other 30% you might be leaving on the table. In some cases, the upside could be even higher.

* That fee also includes DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Axon. All the money will be used for future research and improvements that will be released to the public.

Thanks to the early adopters, I managed to to fund my Master research thesis (that may be published soon) on how to speed up reinforcement learning training by 10 times from the baseline methods. It is already implemented in the DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Neural libraries!

DataPredict™ Neural is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of deep learning features and inflexibility of the API design from the [DataPredict™](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

In addition, if you are interested in Roblox tutorials and future projects by me, then you can subscribe to me in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrwoxv5dufEmbGsxyEUPZw).

## Features

* Take advantage of calculations combining both automatic differentiation and manual differentiation, simplifying complex calculations while maintaining high performance.

* Take advantage of model and data parallelism capabilities as well as static computational graph for extremely fast training, prediction and experimentation.

* Build singular models that are interconnected between servers and clients through distributed training.

* Build models that handles multi-dimensional tensor inputs and outputs to solve any demands of your projects.

* Dive into user-friendly API designed for you to learn in a couple of minutes.

* Built for production-grade and research-grade applications.

* Cross-compatible with DataPredict library.
