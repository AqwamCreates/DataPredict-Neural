DataPredict Neural is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of deep learning features and inflexibility of the API design from the [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).

## Features

* Take advantage of calculations combining both automatic differentiation and manual differentiation, simplifying complex calculations while maintaining high performance.

* Craft complex models effortlessly using dynamic computational graphs, giving you the ability to create any models you want and modify them at runtime.

* Take advantage of model and data parallelism capabilities for extremely fast training, prediction and experimentation.

* Build singular models that are interconnected between servers and clients through distributed training.

* Build models that handles multi-dimensional inputs and outputs to solve any demands of your projects.

* Dive into user-friendly API designed for you to learn in a couple of minutes.

* Built for production-grade and research-grade applications.

* Cross compatible with DataPredict library.
