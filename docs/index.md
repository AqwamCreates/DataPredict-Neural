# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict™ Neural Library!

This library was developed solo over more than 1 year (2000+ hours), which would exceed $100,000 USD in industry costs. Additionally, it requires near PhD-level knowledge to build and test all the models in this library. The cost to produce this library is significantly cheaper due to recycling of DataPredict™ (4000+ hours) library codes. To all indie devs who just starting their business, feel free to use it without burning away your money!

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms And Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md). In short:

* Public attribution is required when using this library.

* A separate agreement is needed for commercial use (both internally and externally). This applies to companies (or individuals, if none) whose combined revenue (including from subsidiaries or related entities) exceeds $3,000 within 365 days (not per 365 days) or those engaged in business-to-business activities.

* If you or your company is applicable to the above statement and do not want a separate agreement, then you are required to follow the "Commercial Use Conditions" in Terms And Conditions.

* Plus some more stuff...

Once you pass the commercial use threshold and want to license it, expect to pay for (gross revenue * (0.03651 / log2(gross revenue))) every month, provided that it uses this library. In other words, it starts at around 1% of gross revenue and that percentage decreases as your project earns more. That fee also includes DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Axon. All the money will be used for future research and improvements that will be released to the public.

Thanks to the early adopters, I managed to to fund my Master research thesis (that may be published soon) on how to speed up reinforcement learning training by 10 times from the baseline methods. It is already implemented in the DataPredict™ and DataPredict™ Neural libraries!

I do not entertain "proof of value" requests. You can read the reasons [here](WhyIDoNotEntertainProofOfValueRequests.md).

DataPredict™ Neural is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of deep learning features and inflexibility of the API design from the [DataPredict™](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).
