# Welcome to Aqwam's DataPredict Neural Library!

By using or possessing any copies of this library or its assets (including the icons), you agree to our [Terms and Conditions](TermsAndConditions.md). In short:

* Attribution is required when using this library. 

* A separate agreement is needed for commercial use (both internally and externally). This applies to companies (or individuals, if none) whose combined revenue (including from subsidiaries or related entities) is at least $3,000 within 365 days (not per 365 days) or those engaged in business-to-business activities.

* If you or your company is applicable to the above statement and do not want a separate agreement, then you are required to follow the "Commercial Use Conditions" in Terms And Conditions.

* Plus some more stuff...

If you suspect any license violations, including those involving your own company, you may be eligible for a bounty reward of up to 50% of the value of the violating company, depending on the ease of prosecution and the strength of the evidence. The license requires that any commercial use of the library must publicly release the code that interacts with it, making the relevant code accessible for review. This ensures compliance and protects employees from personal liability, as violations are typically pursued against the company, not individuals. If you're unsure whether the license is being violated, please contact me directly for confirmation, rather than relying solely on the companyâ€™s statements. The reward is based on the severity of the violation and the ability to prove damages, but it may not reflect the full financial impact or value of the company.

DataPredict Neural is an advanced deep learning library for Roblox and Pure Lua.

This project is created to address the lack of deep learning features and inflexibility of the API design from the [DataPredict](https://aqwamcreates.github.io/DataPredict/) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [Discord](https://discord.gg/BAZsynkede) server, [DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/datapredict-neural-version-beta-zero-pytorch-like-deep-learning-library-meets-roblox/3010845) thread or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).
