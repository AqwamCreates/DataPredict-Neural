# [API Reference](../../API.md) - Utilities(../Utilities.md) - IterativeTrainingWrapper

## Constructors

### new()

Creates a new iterative training wrapper object. If there are no parameters given for that particular argument, then that argument will use default value (except for Model and CostFunction).

```

IterativeTrainingWrapper.new({maxNumberOfIterations: number, Model: ModelObject, CostFunction: CostFunctionObject, targetCostValueUpperBound: number, targetCostValueLowerBound: number, numberOfIterationsToCheckIfConverged: number, numberOfIterationsPerCostCalculation: number, isOutputPrinted: boolean}): IterativeTrainingWrapperObject

```

Parameters:

* maxNumberOfIterations: How many times should the model needed to be trained.

* Model: The model to be used by the iterative training wrapper object.

* CostFunction: The cost function to be used by the iterative training wrapper object.
	
* targetCostValueUpperBound: The upper bound of target cost.

* targetCostValueLowerBound: The lower bound of target cost.
	
* numberOfIterationsToCheckIfConverged: The number of iterations for confirming convergence.
	
* numberOfIterationsPerCostCalculation: The number of iterations for each cost calculation.
	
* isOutputPrinted: A boolean value that specifies if the output is printed.

#### Returns:

IterativeTrainingWrapperObject: The generated iterative training wrapper object.

## Functions

### setParameters()

```

IterativeTrainingWrapper:setParameters({maxNumberOfIterations: number, Model: ModelObject, CostFunction: CostFunctionObject, targetCostValueUpperBound: number, targetCostValueLowerBound: number, numberOfIterationsToCheckIfConverged: number, numberOfIterationsPerCostCalculation: number, isOutputPrinted: boolean}): IterativeTrainingWrapperObject

```

Parameters:

* maxNumberOfIterations: How many times should the model needed to be trained.

* Model: The model to be used by the iterative training wrapper object.

* CostFunction: The cost function to be used by the iterative training wrapper object.
	
* targetCostValueUpperBound: The upper bound of target cost.

* targetCostValueLowerBound: The lower bound of target cost.
	
* numberOfIterationsToCheckIfConverged: The number of iterations for confirming convergence.
	
* numberOfIterationsPerCostCalculation: The number of iterations for each cost calculation.
	
* isOutputPrinted: A boolean value that specifies if the output is printed.

### train()

```

IterativeTrainingWrapper:train(featureTensor: tensor, labelTensor: tensor): {number}

```

#### Parameters:

* featureTensor: The tensor containing all the features.

* labelTensor: The tensor containing all the labels.

#### Returns:

* costValueArray: An array containing the cost values. The first cost value in the array represents the first cost value generated by the iterative training wrapper object.
