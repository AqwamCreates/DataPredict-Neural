# [API Reference](../../API.md) - [Containers](../Containers.md) - RecurrentNeuralNetwork (RNN)

## Constructors

### new()

Creates a new cost function object.

```

RecurrentNeuralNetwork.new({inputDimensionSize: number, hiddenDimensionSize: number, learningRate: number, reverse: boolean}): ContainerObject

```

#### Parameters:

* inputDimensionSize: The number of input features that will be accepted by the recurrent neural network cell.

* hiddenDimensionSize: The number of hidden features that will be generated by the recurrent neural network cell.

* learningRate: The learning rate that will be used by all the weight blocks that are stored in this recurrent neural network cell.

* reverse: Determines whether the predictions should be generated starting from the end of the sequence. [Default: False]

#### Returns:

* Container: The generated container object.
