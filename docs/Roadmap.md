# Roadmap

## Core

The list of items shown below are likely to be implemented due to its mainstream use, increases learning speed or reduces computational resources.

* None.

## Nice-To-Have

The list of items shown below may not necesarily implemented in the future. However, they could be prioritized with external interest or funding.

* Dilated Convolution Neural Network.

  * Enables larger receptive field without more weight parameters.

  * Good in sparse-data settings.

  * Unknown use cases related to game environments.

* Generalized N-Dimensional Convolution Layer And Pooling Layer.

  * Currently we have up to 3 dimensional kernels.

  * Useful for pushing the boundaries of convolutional neural networks.

  * 4 dimensional kernels are used in videos. Unknown use cases for game environments.
